# Untitled React eCommerce Project

Name to be determined!

## Overview

This _will_ be an eCommerce website. My main goal with this project is to strengthen my confidence with a full-stack MERN app. Since I have previously built a simple eCommerce site before -- with the assistance of an instructor -- this project is to be done completely independently. This will be my capstone project, so to speak!

Since the design and CSS are not my main focus, I have decided to expand my React component library experience and have a go with the NextUI library. Although it has a fairly attractive, bold default look to it, I am finding it to be rather limited. I may end up using another library instead, so I am trying to keep my React logic relatively library-agnostic for now.

### Tech Stack

- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node

I will also be making use of the following:

- React Router
- Redux Toolkit
- Next UI (for now)
